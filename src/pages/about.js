              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>Haven Coin & Jewelry was founded in 2003 by Michael and Sarah Thompson, lifelong residents of New Haven with a shared passion for numismatics and fine jewelry. What started as a small coin shop has grown into Connecticut's premier destination for collectors and jewelry enthusiasts.</p>
              
              <p>Our journey began when Michael, a former bank executive, discovered his love for coin collecting during his travels across the United States and Europe. Sarah, with her background in gemology and fine arts, brought expertise in jewelry design and precious stones. Together, they created a unique business that combines the historical fascination of coins with the timeless beauty of jewelry.</p>
              
              <p>Today, Haven Coin & Jewelry serves customers from across New England, offering everything from ancient Roman coins to contemporary engagement rings. Our reputation for authenticity, fair pricing, and exceptional service has made us a cornerstone of New Haven's downtown business district and a trusted name in the numismatic and jewelry communities.</p>
