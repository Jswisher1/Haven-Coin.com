          <h2>Our <span class="text-gold">Story</span></h2>
          <p>Haven Coin & Jewelry was founded in 2003 by Michael and Sarah Thompson, lifelong residents of New Haven with a shared passion for numismatics and fine jewelry. What started as a small coin shop has grown into Connecticut's premier destination for collectors and jewelry enthusiasts.</p>
          
          <p>Our journey began when Michael, a former bank executive, discovered his love for coin collecting during his travels. Sarah, with her background in gemology, brought expertise in fine jewelry and precious stones. Together, they created a unique business that combines the historical fascination of coins with the timeless beauty of jewelry.</p>
          
          <p>Today, Haven Coin & Jewelry serves customers from across New England, offering everything from ancient Roman coins to contemporary engagement rings. Our reputation for authenticity, fair pricing, and exceptional service has made us a cornerstone of New Haven's downtown business district.</p>
